       This module provides a rudimentary interface to the Bar­
       clays Online Banking service at "https://ibank.bar­
       clays.co.uk". You will need either "Crypt::SSLeay" or
       "IO::Socket::SSL" installed for HTTPS support to work with
       LWP.

WWAARRNNIINNGG
       This warning is from Simon Cozens' "Finance::Bank::Lloyd­
       sTSB", and seems just as apt here.

       This is code for oonnlliinnee bbaannkkiinngg, and that means yyoouurr
       mmoonneeyy, and that means BBEE CCAARREEFFUULL. You are encouraged, nay,
       expected, to audit the source of this module yourself to
       reassure yourself that I am not doing anything untoward
       with your banking data. This software is useful to me, but
       is provided under NNOO GGUUAARRAANNTTEEEE, explicit or implied.

TTHHAANNKKSS
       Simon Cozens for "Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB" and Perl
       hand-holding.  Chris Ball for "Finance::Bank::HSBC".
