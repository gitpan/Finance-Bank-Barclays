NAME
    Finance::Bank::Barclays - Check your Barclays bank accounts from Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::Bank::Barclays;
      my @accounts = Finance::Bank::Barclays->check_balance(
              memnumber => "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
              passcode => "12345",
              surname => "Smith",
              password => "xxxxxxxx"
      );

      foreach (@accounts) {
              printf "%8s %8s : GBP %8.2f\n",
              $_->{sort_code}, $_->{account_no}, $_->{balance};
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to the Barclays Online
    Banking service at "https://ibank.barclays.co.uk". You will need either
    "Crypt::SSLeay" or "IO::Socket::SSL" installed for HTTPS support to work
    with LWP.

CLASS METHODS
      check_balance(memnumber => $u, passcode => $p, surname => $s,
        password => $w)

    Return an array of account objects, one for each of your bank accounts.

OBJECT METHODS
      $ac->sort_code
      $ac->account_no

    Return the account sort code (in the format XX-YY-ZZ) and the account
    number.

      $ac->balance

    Return the account balance as a signed floating point value.

WARNING
    This warning is from Simon Cozens' "Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB", and seems
    just as apt here.

    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

THANKS
    Simon Cozens for "Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB" and Perl hand-holding. Chris
    Ball for "Finance::Bank::HSBC".
